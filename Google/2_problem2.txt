A mouse is trying to get from its starting position S to a treat T,
 while moving only on land cells and staying as far away as possible 
 from the cat C. Formally, assume again a square grid of size (N x N), 
 allowing only horizontal and vertical moves, impassable cells with water,
  and cells S, T, and C.
   We want to find a path from S to T for which the minimal 
   distance to C along the path is maximal. Use the L1 (aka. Manhattan) distance measure, i.e., the sum of the horizontal and vertical distances.
