Question 1 : 

houses = {
    {4,5,1},
    {4,6,7},
    {4,8,9}
}

colors = {
    {a,b,c},
    {d,e,f},
    {g,h,i}
}

no duplicate values in neighbouring houses 
->size of all neighboring houes are same 

return the sorted neighbourhood 

ex : (return) => {
    {1,4,5}
    {4,6,7}
    {4,8,9}
}

approach : 
->sort the array (nlogn)
->if repeated fill in the next row
