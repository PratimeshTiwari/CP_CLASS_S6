an array contains various multiplication of all values % m divided by 3.
calculate twin primes 

->calculate all prime numbers where n = a+b+c+d.
if n < 8 , we can't break it 
if even , we take 2,2 (n=4) once else we take 2,3 (n=5) 
then we will use seive 

->min no of operatins to make a and b equal 
   ->valid operation = divisible by prime factor 
    Solve : get hcf and then divide both by hcf
    ->if a and b are equal , then 0 operations
    ->if a and b are not equal , then we will get the hcf of both
    ->then we will divide both a and b by hcf
    ->then we will get the no of operations required to make a and b equal
    code : 


->I m given number k , calculate how many pairs of x,y can be made 
->I m given a number n , i have guess k , return 
the min no of queries for finding k , k can change 
anytime during the question.

->Find xor without using xor operator
